# Mason Lake

This trail was amazing. Halfway up the trail opens up and you can see across the valley. Mount Rainier even peeks through the ridges!

The part I enjoyed the most of this hike was the wind. There would be howling gusts that would echo through the pass drowning out all the other noise. When the wind hit my body it was incredibly refreshing from the heat.

## Water be fallinâ€™

A couple of nice waterfalls are a long the trail.

## Mountains, mountains, mountians

## The Top

Believe it or not there was still a good amount of snow at the top on the lake. There was enough for the trail to get quite slick.

The lake was worth it though :)
