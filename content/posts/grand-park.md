# Grand Park

Grand Park was indeed grand. A wide open field with a clear view of Mount Rainier. The only downside to this trail were the mosquitos -- there were a TON.

## The lake

About half a mile in you reach Lake Eleanor which was very serene, but also very green...

## The field

Grand Park nuff said.

## The mountain

The mountain was OUT this day. Truly magnificent.
