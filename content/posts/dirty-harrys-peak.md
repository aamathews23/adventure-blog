# Dirty Harry’s Peak

Dirty Harry's Peak. A seemingly funny name, but I'm not sure of it's origins. A trail comparable to Mt. Si in both length and elevation gain. Located right outside of Northbend, WA. It's a great trail with beautiful vantage points of the valley and some spectacular rock climbing areas.

## The beginning

Unfortunately, Saturday May 7th, 2022 was not a nice day. It was a typical gray, wet, muddy Seattle day. I had initially set out looking for the Granite Lakes trailhead, but couldn't find it. I decided to hike up to ol' Dirty Harry's as it was the closest trail to my location.

Despite the weather, I was excited to be outside and couldn't wait to get to the top to see what Dirty Harry's was all about.

## Goin’ up

The path up was steep and muddy, my calves burned as I tried not to skate around too much in the mud. Although it was raining, the trees provided a canopy that shield most of the water. With the rain came clouds which blocked the vantage points so the beauty of the valley remained unseen on the way up.

There were a few rock climbing areas that provided a nice place for a break. One in particular was a gigantic boulder in the middle of the forest. It was almost as if it was placed there by something much larger than a human.

At about halfway there was fork in the road; continue on the path up to the peak, or take a shorter path to [Dirty Harry's Balcony](https://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/dirty-harrys-balcony). I continued on wards to the peak, not knowing what awaited me.

## Tragedy strikes

About three quarters from the peak, my nice hike through mud and rain had turned into five feet of snow. Without the proper equipment and not knowing how much further I had to go, I begrudgingly turned around and started my descent without making it to the peak.

## Slidin’ down

Going down wasn't so bad. Most of the snow was packed enough along the trail that I could slide down it in my boots as if they were ice skates. The rain began to let up, and with it the cloud cover. My once cover vantage points were now clear as day and I could see the valley and through the pass.

## Back at the bottom

Reaching my car again was quite bitter sweet. I was happy to back, but sad I didn't get to see the view from the peak. However, looking back over the pictures there was still quite a bit of clouds at the top so I'm not sure if I would've gotten a view even if I had made it.

Dirty Harry's Peak is definitely a hike I would like to do again. Although, next time will be a clear, sunny day without any snow at the top.
