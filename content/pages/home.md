    That's pretty much me in a nutshell! I hope we can work together to solve any problems you have.

        office as a web developer.

        My job functions included:


        * Creating and modifying frontend experiences to streamline workflows and automate tasks.

        * Create and modify backend services to better manage data, send emails, and automate more tasks.
