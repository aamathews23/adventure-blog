    Welcome!


    I studied computer science in college and am coming up on my 4th year of job experience as a software engineer.


    I have a lot of fun programming, but it's not my only interest! I also enjoy video games, hikes, ice hockey, and as of late barbecuing. I'm currently based out of Seattle, WA.


    That's pretty much me in a nutshell! I hope we can work together to solve any problems you have.

        office as a web developer.

        * Creating and modifying frontend experiences to streamline workflows and automate tasks.

        * Create and modify backend services to better manage data, send emails, and automate more tasks.
