    Welcome!


    As mentioned above I'm currently a frontend engineer at [REI Co-op](https://www.rei.com), but I have a full stack engineer background. I studied computer science in college and am coming up on my 4th year of job experience as a software engineer.


    I have a lot of fun programming, but it's not my only interest! I also enjoy video games, hikes, ice hockey, and as of late barbecuing. I'm currently based out of Seattle, WA.


    The hikes here are awesome. Between the Snoqualmie Pass and Mount Rainier National Park there is an abundance of trails to explore. I try my best to blog about my adventures so people can stay updated with where I've been!


    I play on two adult ice hockey teams in the PNW as a goalie and a defensemen. I grew up playing hockey from about 2nd grade through my sophomore year of highschool where I primarily played as a goalie. I love the game and it's a great way to keep myself active.


    That's pretty much me in a nutshell! I hope we can work together to solve any problems you have.
