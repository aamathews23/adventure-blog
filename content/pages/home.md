    Welcome!


    I studied computer science in college and am coming up on my 4th year of job experience as a software engineer.


    I have a lot of fun programming, but it's not my only interest! I also enjoy video games, hikes, ice hockey, and as of late barbecuing. I'm currently based out of Seattle, WA.


    That's pretty much me in a nutshell! I hope we can work together to solve any problems you have.


    Below is a list of my skills:
  skills:
    - Javascript
    - Typescript
    - Node.js
    - React
    - Next.js
    - Netlify
