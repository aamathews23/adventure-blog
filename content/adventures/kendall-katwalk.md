# Kendall Katwalk

This hike was a 14 mile power hike. It was exhausting. The hardest hike I've ever done. That being said, it was worth it. The views were spectacular and I even made a new friend!

## Ridge

The ridge was the coolest part of this hike.

## Marmot

The friend I made was a marmot! He let us get really close, but not too close.

## Snow

There was snow up at the end, so we didn't make it to the final destination :/

## Other Stuff

There was a lot of other cool stuff on this trail: wild flowers, iron, and waterfalls.
