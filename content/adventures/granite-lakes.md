# Granite Lakes

The Granite Creek Trail was an enjoyable, scenic trail. Even through the wet and gray weather the views were impressive. There was still quite a bit of snow in early May which made some fun snow fields. Even with quite a bit of snow, the trail was safe and easy to navigate.

Here's a photo dump from the hike!

## Woah Green?!?!?

The base of the mountain wasn't covered in snow, it wasn't until about 3/4ths of the way up that things got icy. With all of the snow up top it made for some cool waterfalls!

## A little snow

The higher we went the more snow started to show up...This was about 2/3rds of the way up, only a little bit of snow was on the trail.

## TONS of snow

Now we are 3/4ths of the way up and the snow is D-E-E-P.

The snow was so deep my friend fell through and left a nice imprint as we waited for another hiker to pass.

## The Lake

The lake was quite ***cool***. There wasn't much room to stand and hang out, but the view was well worth.

Finally a picture of me, happy to have made it!
